CHAPTER III PARTIES TO NOTES, BILLS AND CHEQUES 26. Every person capable of contracting, according to the law to which he 1s subject, may bind himself and be bound by the making, drawing, acceptance, indorsement, delivery and negotiation of a promissory note, bill of exchange or cheque. Where such an instrument is made, drawn or negotiated by a minor, the making, drawing or negotiation entitles the holder to receive payment of such instrument and to enforce it against any party thereto other than the minor. Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to empower a corporation to make, indorse or accept such instruments except in cases in which, under the law for the time being in force, they are so empowered. 27. Every person capable of binding himself or of being bound, by the making, drawing, acceptance or negotiation of a negotiable instrument, may so bind himself or be bound by a duly authorised agent acting in his name. A general authority to transact business and to receive and discharge debts does not confer upon an agent the power of accepting or indorsing bills of exchange so as to bind his principal. An authority to draw bills of exchange does not of itself import an authority to indorse. '|27A. A partner acting in the firm name may bind the firm by the making, drawing, acceptance or negotiation of a negotiable instrument to the extent authorised by law relating to partnership for the time being in force. | Section 27A was inserted by section 16 of the Negotiable Instruments (Amendment) Ordinance, 1962 (Ordinance No. XLIX of 1962)."
