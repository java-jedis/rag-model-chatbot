The system in operation for superintending the Preamble magistracy and the police, and for controlling and directing the executive Revenue-officers ~|***] has been found to be defective. The Courts of Appeal and Circuit, as now constituted, partly from the extent of country placed under their authority, and partly from their having to discharge the duties of both civil and criminal tribunals, have, in Many cases, failed to afford that prompt administration of justice which it is the duty of the Government to secure for the people. The goal-deliveries have been, in some instances, delayed beyond the term prescribed by law, and a great arrear of cases under appeal has accrued in all the Courts, to the manifest injury of many individuals and to the encouragement of litigation and crime. The Judges of Circuit, when employed singly in the districts under their authority, do not possess sufficient powers, nor have they the opportunity of acquiring sufficient local knowledge, to enable them adequately to control the police or protect the people.
